				 	"An asteroid is a small, rocky body that orbits the sun. Most asteroids are found in the asteroid belt, a region between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. However, some asteroids can be found closer to or farther away from the sun.
<br>
Asteroids range in size from small rocks to objects over 500 km (310 miles) in diameter. They are thought to be remnants from the early solar system, when the planets were forming. Some asteroids are made up of rock and metal, while others are composed of ice, dust, and organic materials.
<br>
Asteroids can pose a potential threat to Earth if they collide with our planet. Scientists are actively studying asteroids and their orbits to better understand their potential impact on Earth and to develop methods for mitigating the risk of an asteroid impact. Some proposed methods include deflecting asteroids away from Earth or destroying them before they can collide with our planet.
<br>
In addition to their potential risks, asteroids also have scientific value. They can provide important information about the composition of the early solar system, and may contain valuable resources such as metals and water that could be used in future space exploration and colonization efforts. Several missions have been sent to study asteroids, including NASA's OSIRIS-REx and Japan's Hayabusa2, which have both returned samples from their respective asteroid targets.
