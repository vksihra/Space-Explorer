          "Our Solar System is a planetary system that orbits around the star known as the Sun. It consists of the Sun and eight planets, along with numerous dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other celestial bodies. The eight planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
          <br>
          The Sun, at the center of the Solar System, contains 99.86% of the total mass in the Solar System. The four inner planets - Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars - are known as the terrestrial planets, which are relatively small and rocky. The four outer planets - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune - are known as the gas giants, which are much larger and composed mainly of gas and ice.
          <br>
          The Solar System also has two asteroid belts, the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud, which are believed to be the source of comets that occasionally enter the inner Solar System. In addition, there are five officially recognized dwarf planets, which include Pluto, Ceres, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris.
          <br>
          The exploration of the Solar System has been a focus of space agencies around the world, including NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Space probes have been sent to all eight planets and various other objects in the Solar System, providing valuable data and insights into the formation and evolution of our Solar System."
