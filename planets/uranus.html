        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is known for its unique feature of being tilted on its side, giving it a very unusual rotation. It is an ice giant, meaning that it is primarily composed of ices such as water, methane, and ammonia, along with a small rocky core.
        <br>
        Uranus was discovered by William Herschel in 1781, and it is the first planet to have been discovered using a telescope. It is a large planet, about four times the diameter of Earth, and it has a thick atmosphere that is mostly composed of hydrogen and helium gas.
        <br>
        The most distinctive feature of Uranus is its tilt, which is at an angle of about 98 degrees, meaning that its axis of rotation is nearly parallel to its orbit around the Sun. This causes its poles to be in almost complete darkness for half of the planet's orbit, and the other half experiences continuous sunlight.
        <br>
        Uranus has 27 known moons, most of which are named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. The largest of these moons is Miranda, which is known for its unique surface features, including canyons, valleys, and other strange formations.
        <br>
        Another interesting feature of Uranus is its ring system, which was discovered in 1977. The rings are composed of small particles of dust and ice, and they are much less prominent than the rings of Saturn. Uranus also has a magnetic field, which is tilted at an angle of about 60 degrees to its rotation axis.
        <br>
        Because of its unique tilt, Uranus experiences extreme seasons, with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous darkness followed by 42 years of continuous sunlight. During its equinoxes, which occur twice in its 84-year orbit around the Sun, Uranus experiences periods of nearly perfect day-night balance.
        <br>
        Uranus has been visited by only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, which flew by the planet in 1986.</p>
