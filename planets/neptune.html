        Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in our solar system. It is an ice giant, like Uranus, and is composed mostly of hydrogen, helium, and water, with traces of methane and ammonia. Neptune is about four times the size of Earth and has a thick atmosphere that contains visible clouds and storms.
        <br>
        Neptune was discovered in 1846 by astronomers Urbain Le Verrier and Johann Galle, who used mathematical calculations to predict the existence of the planet. It is named after the Roman god of the sea, due to its blue color and the mythological associations with the sea.
        <br>
        One of the most notable features of Neptune is its Great Dark Spot, which is a massive storm that was first observed in 1989 by the Voyager 2 spacecraft. The storm is about the size of Earth and is similar in appearance to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The storm is located in Neptune's southern hemisphere and can be seen through telescopes on Earth.
        <br>
        Neptune also has a series of white clouds that move at high speeds in the opposite direction of the planet's rotation, which is called "retrograde motion." These clouds are thought to be the result of the planet's strong winds, which can reach speeds of up to 1,200 miles per hour.
        <br>
        Neptune has 14 known moons, the largest of which is Triton.
        Only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, has visited Neptune. It flew by the planet in 1989 and provided scientists with detailed images and data about the planet's atmosphere, magnetic field, moons, and rings.
        <br>
        In conclusion, Neptune is a fascinating and mysterious planet in our solar system. Its Great Dark Spot, retrograde motion, and strong magnetic field make it a subject of ongoing study for scientists and astronomers. Future missions to the planet may provide even more insights into its geology, climate, and potential for supporting life.
