        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun and the largest planet in our solar system. It is a gas giant, meaning that it is predominantly composed of hydrogen and helium gas. It was named after the Roman king of gods and is known for its massive size, intricate weather patterns, and numerous moons.
<br>
Jupiter is about 11 times larger than Earth in diameter, and its mass is over 300 times that of Earth. Its size and mass give it a strong gravitational pull, making it the dominant gravitational force in the solar system after the Sun. This gravitational pull has helped shape the orbits of many planets, asteroids, and comets in our solar system.
<br>
Jupiter is also known for its iconic Great Red Spot, which is a massive storm that has been raging for at least 350 years. The storm is so large that it could easily swallow up Earth several times over. In addition to the Great Red Spot, Jupiter's atmosphere is home to a complex system of cloud bands, jet streams, and storms, some of which are larger than Earth itself.
<br>
Jupiter has at least 79 known moons, the four largest of which are known as the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. These moons were first observed by Galileo Galilei in 1610 and are named after him. The Galilean moons are some of the largest objects in the solar system outside of the Sun and the eight planets.
<br>
Jupiter plays an important role in protecting Earth from potentially dangerous asteroids and comets. Its strong gravitational pull can deflect or capture these objects, preventing them from colliding with our planet. Scientists believe that Jupiter's gravity may have even played a role in the formation of our solar system, helping to clear out debris and create the stable orbits we observe today.
