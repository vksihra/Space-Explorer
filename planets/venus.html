      <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is the sixth largest planet in our Solar System. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty due to its bright, shimmering appearance in the sky. Venus is often called the "Morning Star" or "Evening Star" because it is visible just before sunrise or just after sunset.
        <br>
        Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere that is composed primarily of carbon dioxide with clouds of sulfuric acid. These clouds reflect sunlight, which gives the planet its characteristic bright appearance. The thick atmosphere also traps heat, making Venus the hottest planet in our Solar System with surface temperatures that can reach up to 864 degrees Fahrenheit (462 degrees Celsius).
        <br>
        Venus rotates very slowly on its axis, taking about 243 Earth days to complete a single rotation, which is longer than it takes for Venus to orbit the Sun. This means that a day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus. Venus also rotates in the opposite direction to most planets in our Solar System, which is known as retrograde rotation.
        <br>
        Despite being a rocky planet like Earth, Venus has no moons and no magnetic field. It has a similar size and composition to Earth, which has led to comparisons between the two planets. Scientists have sent several missions to Venus to study its atmosphere and surface, including the Magellan spacecraft, which mapped the planet's surface in detail in the 1990s.
        <br>
        Venus is one of the brightest objects in the sky and has been observed and studied for thousands of years. Today, scientists continue to study Venus to learn more about the planet's atmosphere, geology, and potential habitability.
