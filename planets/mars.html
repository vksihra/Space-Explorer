        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is commonly referred to as the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance in the night sky. It is a terrestrial planet, meaning that it is composed primarily of rock and metal, and is about half the size of Earth.
<br>
Mars has been a subject of fascination and study for many years due to its similarities to Earth. It has a day-night cycle that is similar to Earth's, and its axial tilt gives it seasons like Earth's. Mars also has polar ice caps that grow and shrink with the changing seasons, much like Earth's polar ice caps.
<br>
One of the most prominent features of Mars is the massive shield volcano known as Olympus Mons, which is the largest volcano in the solar system. Mars is also home to Valles Marineris, a massive canyon system that stretches for more than 4,000 km and is up to 7 km deep.
<br>
Scientists believe that Mars may have once had liquid water on its surface, which makes it a prime target in the search for extraterrestrial life. There is evidence that ancient river channels and lake beds exist on the planet, and recent discoveries suggest that liquid water may still exist beneath the surface.
<br>
Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are irregularly shaped and heavily cratered. These moons are thought to be captured asteroids, and their origins are still a subject of study.
<br>
In recent years, there have been several missions to Mars, both by space agencies and private companies. NASA's Mars Exploration Rover and Mars Science Laboratory missions have explored the planet's surface, while the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission has studied the planet's atmosphere.
