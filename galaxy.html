				"A galaxy is a vast, gravitationally bound system of stars, dust, gas, and dark matter, as well as other astronomical objects, such as star clusters, nebulae, and black holes, that are held together by their mutual gravitational attraction. Galaxies come in a variety of shapes and sizes, ranging from small, irregular dwarf galaxies with just a few million stars to massive elliptical galaxies with trillions of stars.

				Our own Milky Way galaxy is a spiral galaxy with a diameter of about 100,000 light-years and contains over 100 billion stars. Galaxies are classified based on their shape, with the three primary types being elliptical, spiral, and irregular.

				Elliptical galaxies have a more spherical or ellipsoidal shape and contain mostly old stars, while spiral galaxies, like the Milky Way, have a flattened disk shape and contain a mix of old and young stars, as well as interstellar gas and dust. Irregular galaxies, as their name suggests, have a more irregular shape and contain a mix of young and old stars, as well as gas and dust.

				The study of galaxies, known as galactic astronomy, has greatly expanded our understanding of the universe and the laws of physics that govern it. By studying the motions and properties of stars within galaxies, astronomers can gain insights into the history and evolution of galaxies, as well as the distribution of dark matter within them."
